#  Overview of Project

This repository contains the code and resources for detecting Arabic texts generated by artificial intelligence compared to those written by humans, using machine learning and deep learning models based on transformer embeddings.
The system includes advanced Arabic text processing, sentence embeddings using transformer technology, and a suite of machine learning and deep learning classifiers to ensure reliable performance.

#  Description of Task

The task is defined as a binary classification challenge, where each text is categorized as:

- **0 realted to AI-generated**
- **1 realted to Human-written**

Each Arabic abstract undergoes processing and is encoded into embeddings, followed by classification using one of several available trained models. The project aims to tackle the growing challenge of identifying automatically generated Arabic academic texts.

#  Data Collection

We utilize a substantial dataset comprising 41,940 Arabic research abstracts, which includes:

- **AI-generated abstracts produced using various large language models (LLMs)**
- **Human-written abstracts**
